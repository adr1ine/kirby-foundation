      <h5>our founders were inspired by kirby's ability to transform into whatever foods that he ate, and that got them wondering -- was there any way to recreate that in real life, considering the ramifications that could possibly have for solving hunger around the world?</h5>

      <h5>well, fifteen years later, we had our answer: probably not.<br><br><br>but that doesn't mean that we stopped trying to solve pay gaps, pay inequalities, and hunger. we just took it in a different direction and after some thinking, we realized: why not just go back to our roots?<br><br><span style="background-color: #b0f7ff;">that was when the kirby foundation was truly reborn -- by turning a popular american video game character into a symbol of charity (and by partnering with its parent company, nintendo), we were able to help raise awareness about these issues, and that brings us to today.</h5></span><br><br>
