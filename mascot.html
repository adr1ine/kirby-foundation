        <summary>then what did kirby do in this game?</summary>
        <h4>his main abilities in-game include inhaling any object, even if it is larger than him, and afterwards, he is able to spit it out as a projectile or to swallow it.</h4>
        <br><br>
        <h4>kirby resides in a kingdom called <i>dream land</i>, on a planet that is shaped like a five-pointed star, called <i>popstar</i>, hence his typical depiction being alongside a star or multiple stars. <i>popstar</i> is also home to creatures called waddle dees, who occasionally appear as enemies, but most regularly as a friend of kirby.</h4>
